This means that (7, 9) is a solution to the problem.\n29. As the problem asks for all possible solutions, we need to check to see if there is a valid solution for (n, 10) or columns 10 and 11 transposed under some weight n even though we found a solution already. It is possible the solution we found is not unique.\n30. \"Fix\" the columns in the first number and see if any n from 1-9 can generate the proper check digit. Calculations:\n978-354181391-9\n978-354181319-9\n(9+7n+8+3n+5+4n+1+8n+1+3n+1+9n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 9)\nn = 4 and n = 9 are both possible solutions to this modular equation.\n31. \"Fix\" the columns in the second number and see if n = 4 and n = 9 are still solutions:\n978-946669746-1\n978-946669764-1\n(9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ (10 - 1)\nWhen n = 4, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ 8, so n cannot be 4. When n = 9, (9+7n+8+9n+4+6n+6+6n+9+7n+6+4n) mod 10 ≡ 3, so n cannot be 9. As neither solution found works for the second number, this fails. There is no consistent solution if columns 10 and 11 are transposed.\n32. We checked all possible forms of the error and found only one potential solution, (7, 9) so this is our only answer.",

    "Question": "I was trying to remember how well the Cheater Beater performed in comparison to the Cheater when James tested it on his channel. I know that the Cheater still outperformed the Cheater Beater in terms of CFM. Could you please look that up for me, and report the CFM of both the Cheater and the Cheater Beater? I'm not sure if he made any changes to his testing, but this was back in season 4, so just report the value from that season. Please format your response like this: CFM number for Cheater, CFM number for Cheater beater",

Noted that R = 8.31446261815324 J/K-mol.\n6. Searched \"Freon-12\" on Google.\n7. Opened the \"Dichlorodifluoromethane\" on Wikipedia.\n8. Noted the molar mass of 120.91 g/mol.\n9. Converted 0.312 kg = 312 g.\n10. Calculated moles: 312 g / 120.91 g/mol = 2.58 mol.\n11. Searched \"Marianas Trench pressure\" on Google.\n12. Noted the pressure in the featured text snippet of 15,750 psi.\n13. Searched \"psi to atm\" on Google.\n14. Noted 1 psi = 0.068046 atm.\n15.
