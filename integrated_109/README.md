**Integrated GAIA Task Dataset with Validation**

The core dataset of this repository: 109 GAIA benchmark tasks integrated into a unified format with complete execution plans, tool annotations, and validation results.

---

## Overview

This directory consolidates tasks from multiple sources (original GAIA Level 3, TA-provided tasks, and internally authored tasks) into a single, consistently formatted collection. Every task has been executed through the Parser v5 pipeline and validated against gold-standard answers.

### Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total tasks | 109 |
| Level 1 (L1) | 38 |
| Level 2 (L2) | 50 |
| Level 3 (L3) | 21 |
| Total steps | 17,661 |
| Tool invocation steps | 426 |
| Reasoning steps | 17,235 |
| Validation pass rate | 100% |

## Task Format

Each task is stored as a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "task_id": "GAIA_L3_001",
  "level": 3,
  "query": "What is the total revenue reported in the attached PDF for Q3 2024?",
  "gold_answer": "4.2 billion USD",
  "attachments": ["data/report_q3_2024.pdf"],
  "plan": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "step_id": 1,
        "tool": "pdf_reader",
        "parameters": {"file": "data/report_q3_2024.pdf"},
        "dependencies": []
      },
      {
        "step_id": 2,
        "tool": "reasoning",
        "input": "{step_1_result}",
        "dependencies": [1]
      }
    ]
  },
  "validation": {
    "status": "pass",
    "predicted_answer": "4.2 billion USD",
    "match_type": "exact"
  }
}
```

## Level Distribution

```
L1 (38 tasks)  ████████████████████                     34.9%
L2 (50 tasks)  ██████████████████████████               45.9%
L3 (21 tasks)  ███████████                              19.3%
```

Level 3 tasks account for a disproportionate share of total steps due to their multi-tool, multi-hop nature.

---

## Usage

### Run the full pipeline on all 109 tasks

```bash
python integrated_109/run_pipeline.py --all
```

### Validate results against gold answers

```bash
python integrated_109/validate.py \
  --tasks integrated_109/tasks/ \
  --output integrated_109/validation_results/
```

### Integrate new tasks into the dataset

```bash
python integrated_109/integrate_tasks.py \
  --source new_tasks/ \
  --target integrated_109/tasks/
```

## Validation Details

The validator supports multiple matching strategies:

| Match Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `exact` | String equality after normalization |
| `numeric` | Numeric comparison with configurable tolerance |
| `set` | Unordered set equivalence |
| `substring` | Gold answer appears within predicted answer |
| `semantic` | LLM-based semantic equivalence check (fallback) |

All 109 tasks pass validation under the appropriate match type.

## Notes

- Task attachments (PDFs, spreadsheets, etc.) are stored in `/data` at the repository root.
- Plans were generated by Parser v5 and have not been manually edited.
- Step counts include both tool invocations and intermediate reasoning steps inserted by the parser.
