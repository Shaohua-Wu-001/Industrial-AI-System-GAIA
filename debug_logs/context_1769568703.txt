TASK: What animals that were mentioned in both Ilias Lagkouvardos's and Olga Tapia's papers on the alvei species of the genus named for Copenhagen outside the bibliographies were also present in the 2021 article cited on the alvei species' Wikipedia page about a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study?

Most standard microbiology texts list mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, soil, water, sewage, and foods as sources from which hafniae can be recovered.
The gastrointestinal tracts of animals, and in particular mammals, appear to be a very common ecologic habitat for
hafniae
. Paleomicrobiology investigations have identified
H. alvei
originating from intestinal mass samples and sediment collected from 12,000-year-old mastodon remains in Michigan and Ohio. In a study of 642 Australian mammals, Gordon and FitzGibbon

History
[
edit
]
The genus
Hafnia
is one of more than 40 genera that currently comprise the order
Enterobacterales
.
Although Møller originally described this genus in 1954, the legitimacy of this group was constantly challenged over the next two decades, often being referred to by synonyms such as "
Enterobacter alvei
", "
Enterobacter aerogenes subsp. hafniae
" and "
Enterobacter hafniae
" but it is mostly referenced by its current name,
Hafnia alvei,
in the literature.

In 1977, a study concluded that at the end of
Camembert
manufacturing
Hafnia alvei
remains as the dominant species.
Hafnia alvei
is a psychrotrophic strain, which can develop at low temperatures, meaning that it doesn't stop growing during the storage phase of cheese unlike
E. coli
.
[

]
In 1983,
Enterobacterales
were discovered in freshly produced Camembert:
[

]
51% of the identified
Enterobacterales
were
Hafnia alvei
strains compared to only 9% of
Escherichia coli
.
These authors also showed that
Hafnia alvei
grew to a  high concentration in cheese (up to 10
7
CFU/g), in both raw milk and pasteurised milk cheeses.
A few years later, in 1987,
Hafnia alvei
was identified by a Spanish team in raw
ewes' milk
representing 6.5% of the total
Enterobacterales
species present.

Abstract
Hafnia alvei
is receiving increasing attention from both a medical and veterinary point of view, but the diversity of molecules it produces has made the interest in this bacterium extend to the field of probiotics, the microbiota, and above all, to its presence and action on consumer foods. The production of Acyl Homoserine Lactones (AHLs), a type of quorum-sensing (QS) signaling molecule, is the most often-studied chemical signaling molecule in Gram-negative bacteria.
H. alvei
can use this communication mechanism to promote the expression of certain
