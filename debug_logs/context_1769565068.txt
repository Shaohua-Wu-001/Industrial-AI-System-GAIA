TASK: In the NCATS PubChem compound database for Food Additive Status classification, find the compound that has a molecular weight of 100 g/mol or less, 6 heavy atoms, 1 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors, and a complexity between 10 and 15. Of the shared gene-chemical co-occurrences between its two possible enzyme transformations, what is the PubChem CID of the heaviest by molecular weight?
